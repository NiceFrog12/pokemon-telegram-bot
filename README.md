# Telegram Pokemon Fighting Bot

It is a small side project of mine which uses a big Pokemon API to get information about Pokemons' stats, so that you can later pair them up against your friends' Pokemon! It also has a couple other features which I will explain shortly.

## Features
- **Getting your own Pokemon**  
  Just run the `/go` command after starting the bot, and it will give you a random Pokemon to use in battle.

- **Feeding your Pokemon**  
  You can feed your Pokemon every 30 seconds to increase its HP by increments of 10 (or whatever you put in the settings).

- **Multiple types of Pokemon**  
  Currently, there are only 2 types. Your Pokemon has a 50% chance to become a fighter type on spawn, which will modify its stats: decreasing its HP but increasing its damage.

- **Fighting your friends**  
  If you type `/fight` or `/battle` and reply to a message from your friend, you can start fighting their Pokemon. Currently, there is no turn system, so whoever has the fastest fingers to spam the command wins. (sorry!)

## Project's Future
I have a couple of ideas for improving the bot:
- **Turn-based System**: I plan to add a turn system so that you can't just spam the command and instantly kill the enemy Pokemon.
- **Damage Modifiers**: I'll add modifiers based on Pokemons' damage types. For example, Squirtle's ability will do water-type damage, Pikachu's ability will do lightning damage, etc.
- **More Pokemon Types**: I might add more types of Pokemon that will enhance their stats in different ways. For example, a Mage type could increase elemental damage but reduce HP/normal damage.
